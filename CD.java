 * @author (Plamen Savchev @00533641 Group 1.1) 
 * 
 * @version (0.3 25/10/19)
 * 
 * Class CD simulates creating an entry for a CD in a library. The class have a 
 * default hard-coded constructor and one that expect entries for title, artist,
 * number of tracks and cost. On both costructor there is variable for 
 * borrower with default value of null and boolean variable if the CD is
 * in stock with default value - true.
 * 
 * There are 5 Accessor moethod which allow you to check to title, artist, number of 
 * tracks, cost and to print a full report.
 * 
 * The following mutator method borrow() adds the functionality CD to be borrowed.
 * Initially the the method had an actual parameter that was expecting surname entry
 * in the CD class. However, the method has been modify as expected in the homework
 * sheet and now once the method is used, expect an selection of an existing borrower
 * from the object bench created by the Borrower class. Once done, 
 * 
 * The last 3 mutator methods have the functionality to return the CD, report the 
 * CD is currently in stock or not and calculate the earnings from a CD respectively. 
 * The first 2 are using "if" statement while the last one return simple arithmetics to
 * determine the earnings.
